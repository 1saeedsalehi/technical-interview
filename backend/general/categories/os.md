# Operating System

* Process Control Block
* Degree of multiprogramming
* Short Term Scheduler
  * Also known as the CPU scheduler
  * decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU)
* Medium Term Scheduler
  * Removes the processes from the memory
* Long Term Scheduler
  * Also called a job scheduler
  * Selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for CPU scheduling
* Loading process into memory
  * Contiguous allocation
    * Fixed partitioning
    * Dynamic partitioning
      * Compaction
  * Non-contagious allocation
* Frame
