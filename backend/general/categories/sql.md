# SQL Server

* Normalization
  * Suitable for online transaction processing systems (OLTP)
  * 1NF
  * 2NF
  * 3NF
* Denormalization
  * Suitable for online analytical processing systems (OLAP)
* Primary-key constraint
  * Enforces the uniqueness of rows and also disallows NULLs in the constraint attributes
  * To enforce the uniqueness of the logical primary-key constraint, SQL Server will create
      a unique index behind the scenes. A unique index is a physical mechanism used by
      SQL Server to enforce uniqueness
* Unique constraint
  * SQL Server will create a unique index behind the scenes as the physical mechanism to enforce
      the logical unique constraint.

      * Prevent phenomenon called phantom reads
  * Isolation levels based on row versioning
    * SNAPSHOT
    * READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT
  * Deadlocks
    * SQL Server chooses to terminate the transaction that did the least work
        (based on the activity written to the transaction log)

  * DDL
    * Database scope
      * For events with a database scope, such as CREATE TABLE
    * Server scope
      * For events with a server scope, such as CREATE DATABASE
    * SQL Server supports only after DDL triggers; it doesnâ€™t support instead of DDL triggers
    * Can be used for
      * Auditing
      * Policy enforcement
      * Change management
