# Cryptography

* Types of Attacks
  * Cryptanalysis
  * Brute Force
* Types of Encryption
  * Symmetric
  * Asymmetric
* Block vs Stream Cipher
* DES
  * Symmetric
  * Block Cipher (64 bits each)
  * Insecure due to the relatively short 56-bit key size
  * Triple DES
* AES
  * Symmetric
  * Also known as Rijndael
  * Block Cipher (128 bits each)
* RSA
  * Asymmetric
  * Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
  * Encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private)
* Diffie-Hellman key exchange
* Digital signature
* Digital certificate
* SSL and SSL certificate
* SSL/TLS handshake protocol
